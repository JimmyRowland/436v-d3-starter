# CPSC 436V d3 starter

### Why?
D3 is a very old library written in Javascript with functions returning functions. As a result, IDE autocomplete/intellisense is very limited. This project aims to provide a better experience for students. This vite template from [stackBlitz](https://vite.new/vanilla-ts) provides d3 autocomplete and hot reload thanks to `@types/d3` and `vite`.
